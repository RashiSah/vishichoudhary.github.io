# Me and Manjaro linux

So it was the time of mid july 2017 i got bore with ubuntu linux (no offense). I was looking for a switch.<br>
I tried my hand on various distros like debian, fedora and many other but they seems not fit for me.<br>
Then i come to know about Rolling Release Development Model. And seriously it's something that just enough to make me switch my os.<br>
Then the googling begin about RRDM based os, got few names like arch, manjaro, BlackArch and many other<br>
I was afraid to try Arch linux (Thanks to many blog, memes). I thought to try Manjaro, downloaded it and was installing it, unfortunately it was a unsuccessful install and i messed up with things. Had to format my entire hard drive. Not complaining but i want to format, Just putting my blame on that installation :).<br>
Than i made my heart to try arch linux (I like challenges, my mind said) and successful to install by putting the whole day. And then installing graphic-card drivers and while installing xorg i don't know what happened , i messed up again. I already wasted my 2-3 days in os switching.<br>
And can't afford to loose more , i just switched back to ubuntu .... lol (fugitive my mind said). This time i ignored my mind. And not wasting my summers vacation i start working.<br>
During the ending of vacation i thought of giving arch one more chance. This time I succed. Wohoo finally . I really enjoyed arch linux, used it for almost 7-8 months. And one day i was trying to do a system upgrade and got messed firefox was not working. I searched a lot and found out that each app makes a clone of itself while running and two clones kills each other i don't know why (may be they were out of resources).<br> 
Then i installed manjaro linux along side arch linux. It's pretty, i mean it's seriously pretty. Everything works out of the box. Gives me the power of RRDM. Looks elegant, cool. I am in just love with it. Graphic-driver etc etc works out of the box. What else you want. Power of arch linux mixed with great support.<br>
I will recommend you to have a try at it<br>.
